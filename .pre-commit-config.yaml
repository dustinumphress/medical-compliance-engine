        # Requires trufflehog installed locally or we can use the docker version manually
        # This setup assumes you have the binary or use a docker wrapper.
        # For simplicity in this demo, let's use the lightweight python detect-secrets as an alternative if trufflehog binary is missing
        # OR just keep trufflehog if we assume the user will install it.
        # Let's switch to a python-native one for easier setup: "detect-secrets-hook" is popular but trufflehog is better.
        # We will leave trufflehog because I recommended it.
